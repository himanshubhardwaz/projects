# Streamlining Google Meet with the Google Meet Auto Mute Extension

Have you ever found yourself frustrated by the repetitive process of setting up a Google Meet session? As someone who relies on Google Meet for communication and collaboration, I often found the multiple clicks required to initiate a meeting, mute audio and video, and then copy the meeting URL to be time-consuming and cumbersome.

To address this issue, I decided to build the Google Meet Auto Mute extension. Using TypeScript and Webpack, technologies that were new to me at the time, I embarked on the journey of simplifying the Google Meet experience.

The goal of the Google Meet Auto Mute extension is simple: reduce the multiple clicks required to initiate a Google Meet session to just one click. With the extension installed, users can effortlessly create a Google Meet session with a single click of a button. The extension also automatically mutes both audio and video upon meeting initiation, ensuring a distraction-free environment from the start. Additionally, the meeting URL is conveniently copied to the clipboard, ready to be shared with participants.

While developing the extension, I embraced the challenge of learning Webpack, seeing it as an opportunity to expand my skill set and explore new technologies.

Today, I'm excited to share the Google Meet Auto Mute extension with the world, confident that it will transform the Google Meet experience for countless users. Whether you're a busy professional or a student collaborating on group projects, this extension is designed to streamline your workflow and enhance productivity.

But the journey doesn't end here. As I continue to refine and improve the extension, I'm eager to explore new features and functionalities that will further enhance the Google Meet experience for users worldwide.
